Testing GitHub

Hello people!

This is my first time using GitHub and I have already discovered that for a "private" account it will cost you $$$. How or will NASPI pay for a private account, I don't know.

Interesting interface. The GitHub Platform will take some time getting use to as I am very fond of the SharePoint check in/out feature and being able to edit in realtime with other collaborators. For working on a technical report or a white paper the GitHub platform seems to be a bit technical for non-computer techy people.

If I edits this document again and enter extended comments below where do those comments appear? Let's find out. I was interrupted. How does Github chek speling. It doesn't apearr to. Teresa ehlp with grammer and speling.
